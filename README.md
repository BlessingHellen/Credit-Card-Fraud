# Credit-Card-Fraud
Credit Card Fraud Detection with Decision Trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - A comparison
This project explores a credit card transaction dataset to detect fraudulent activity using machine learning.

## Objectives:
- Explore and understand the dataset
- Preprocess and balance the data
- Train and evaluate a classification model
- Discuss challenges like class imbalance

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## Dataset:
[Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

> This dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. It presents a severe class imbalance, with only 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions.

## Notebook:
All code and analysis is available in the [Credit Card Fraud Detection.ipynb](./Credit%20Card%20Fraud%20Detection.ipynb) notebook.
